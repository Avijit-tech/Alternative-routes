# Alternative Routes in Road Networks

This project implements a system to find alternative routes in road networks using Dijkstra’s shortest path algorithm and simulates traffic with OpenGL.

## Features
- Graph representation of road networks.
- Dijkstra’s algorithm for shortest path finding.
- Traffic simulation with vehicle speed adjustments.
- OpenGL visualization of the road network and vehicle movements.

## Requirement
- C++17
- OpenGL
- GLUT

## Building the Project
1. Clone the repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run `mkdir build` to create a build directory.
4. Run `cd build` to navigate into the build directory.
5. Run `cmake ..` to generate the build files.
6. Run `make` to compile the project.
7. Run `./bin/main` to execute the program.

## Usage
- The program will initialize the road network, find the shortest path, and simulate vehicle movements.
- OpenGL will render the road network and vehicles in real-time.
